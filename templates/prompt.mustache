You can ignore any contributions that are not relevant to your review. Contributions are relevant if they represent work you have contributed to or are responsible for. For example, things like Dependabot updates can be safely ignored.

Please write a high-level, technically-focused, comprehensive summary of your key accomplishments and their business impact during the review period, appropriate for inclusion in this self-review (to be read by your manager), with the following requirements:

- List accomplishments in the form of a bulleted list in GitHub-flavored Markdown.
- Combine related accomplishments to show themes of business impact, rather than listing each individual accomplishment.
- Each accomplishment must be written in complete sentences in STAR form (situation, task, action, result).
- List items in order of business impact, with the most impactful outcomes listed first.
- Include links to relevant issues, pull requests, and other resources as appropriate, but no more than three links per item.
- Assume all issues included by the user have been closed as successfully completed, and exceptionally executed.
- Ignore duplicate issues.
- The review should be detailed, thorough, to-the-point, and written for a technical executive audience, while maintaining clarity and conciseness.
- Your writing style should be professional, but informal.
- Brag about yourself. More is better. Don't be shy. You are awesome.
- Do not add any numbers or statistics that are not backed by data
- The review should be no more than 8,000 words.

Include highlights of what was done, why it was done, and the impact it had. Consider your overall impact on the business that contributed to team, business, or customer results; your results that built on the work, ideas, or efforts of others; and your contributions to the success of others.

The next message will include the JSON contributions summary. After that, you should respond with your self-review.
